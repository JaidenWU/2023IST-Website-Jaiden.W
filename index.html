<p> Popular video game League of Legends (LoL), has corrupted the minds of young children. 
In today's society, it has made children more violent and exposes them countlessly to explicit and vile language. 
  Multiple people instantly regret dowloading the game, even calling it the worst decision of their life. </p>

  <h2> What is League of Legends </h2>
  <p> League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games.
    Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. 
    Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. 
    The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS. </p>
  
  <p> In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. 
    Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. 
    During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. 
    In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within. </p>
  
  <p> <em> League of Legends </em> has received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility, character designs, and production value. 
    The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews trending positively; the <strong> negative </strong> and <strong> abusive </strong>
    in-game behavior of its players, criticized since early in the game's lifetime, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the problem. </p>
